            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science that focuses on creating systems 
            capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. Machine Learning, a subset of AI, 
            involves the development of algorithms that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.
             AI and Machine Learning have applications in various domains,
            from healthcare and finance to autonomous vehicles and natural language processing.
            Artificial Intelligence (AI): AI involves the creation of intelligent systems that can mimic human-like thinking and 
            decision-making. This field includes subdomains like natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. 
            AI applications range from virtual assistants like Siri to self-driving cars and medical diagnostics.
            Machine Learning (ML): ML is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms that allow systems to learn from data. 
            ML models can make predictions, classify objects, and recognize patterns without being explicitly programmed. 
            Common applications include recommendation systems, fraud detection, and image recognition.</p>
